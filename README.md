## ACN Di-React-ory

## Description
A website built on the MERN stack in order to make it easier for creatives to search each other based on name, medium, skills, or social media handles. 

## Roadmap
The future plan is instead of populating the directory through a user submitted form to use the Sheets API and a google form. This way people can use either the sheet or the website to look up other creatives.
